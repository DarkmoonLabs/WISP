WISP Commercial License for OEMs, ISVs and VARs
Darkmoon Labs (a Kai Steinmann Consulting Brand) provides its WISP server and WISP Client Libraries under a dual license model 
designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors (such as OEMs, ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.

For OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Applications:
OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that combine 
and distribute commercially licensed software with WISP software and do not wish to distribute the source code for the commercially licensed 
software under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL") must enter into a commercial license agreement with Darkmoon Labs (a Kai Steinmann Consulting Brand).

For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications:
For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with WISP software, 
Darkmoon Labs' WISP open source software licensed under the GPL is the best option.

For developers and distributors of open source software under a FOSS license other than the GPL, Darkmoon Labs makes its GPL-licensed WISP Client Libraries 
available under a FOSS Exception that enables use of the those WISP Client Libraries under certain conditions without causing the entire derivative work 
to be subject to the GPL.
